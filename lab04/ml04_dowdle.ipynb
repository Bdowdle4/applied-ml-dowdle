    "# Dowdle's Titanic Fare Prediction\n",
    "**Author:** Brittany Dowdle   \n",
    "**Date:** April 3, 2025   \n",
    "**Objective:** Use the data you inspected, explored, and cleaned previously. Select a numeric target and build and evaluate different models for predicting a continuous variable using regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict fare - the amount of money paid for the journey - based on features such as age, family size, and embark_town. I will train a linear regression model, evaluate performance using key metrics, and create visualizations to interpret the results.   \n",
    "There will be 4 different cases tested: case 1 - age, case 2 - family_size, case 3 - age and family_size, and case 4 - embark_town.   \n",
    "And there will be comparisons to alternative models: ridge regression, elastic net, and polynomial regression.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Imports\n",
    "In the code cell below, import the necessary Python libraries for this notebook. All imports should be at the top of the notebook."
